minFTP is a minimalistic terminal-based FTP client written in Python. Simple but powerful, it allows you to perform all basic functionalities of a standard client. This version is in beta testing so it's easy to find bugs or defects. If you find them, please report. 

Here we have some features:

<ul>
<li>Integrated Shell for commands</li>
<li>Uploading and Downloading files ( with progressbar )</li>
<li>Create folders</li>
<li>Rename and delete files/folders</li>
<li>Move to directories</li>
</ul>

Usage is pretty simple, from terminal:
{% highlight bash %}
python minFTP.py -h "hostname" -u "username" -p "password"
{% endhighlight %}
or:
{% highlight bash %}
python minFTP.py --host "hostname" --user "username" --pass "password"
{% endhighlight %}
