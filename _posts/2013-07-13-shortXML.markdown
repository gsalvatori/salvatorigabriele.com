short XML is a simple Python command-line tool which allows you to interact with Google URL shortener service (goo.gl), together with a fast and well structure XML database, in order to save and search your short URLs inside it.

Usage is extremely simple, from command-line:

{% highlight bash %}
python shortXML.py -u "longURL"
{% endhighlight  %}

where "longURL" should be replaced with the URL you want to shorten.

So, you will have three choices:

insert : set a title and returns shortURL
view : view all shortURL inside database
search : search a particular shortURL from title

When you run the insert option, the client searches if a "database.xml" file exist. Otherwise he will creates a new one with this structure:

{% highlight html %}
<links></links>
{% endhighlight  %}

and continues with procedure. Once user has entered the title, finally it will be returned the short URL and database will be updated in this way:

{% highlight html %}
<links>
     <link>
       <title>title<title>
       <url>short URL<url>
     </link>
</links>
{% endhighlight  %}

Obviously, you can find the entire project hosted on <a href="https://github.com/gabriele-salvatori/shortXML"><b>Github</b></a>. If you find bugs or have tips or tricks you can recommend, please let me know. It will be greatly appreciated.
