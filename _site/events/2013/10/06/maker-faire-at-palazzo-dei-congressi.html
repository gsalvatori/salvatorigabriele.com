          <h2>Maker Faire @ Palazzo dei Congressi, Rome.</h2>
<p class="meta">06 Oct 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Today I had the pleasure to attend one of the greatest events on innovation and technology, which took place at the Congress Palace in Rome.</p>

<p>Directly from the home page:</p>

<p><i>« Maker Faire is first of all an explosion of ideas, energy, creativity, fun. An event open to the public where protagonists are makers. People who have the vision, the ability and the courage to transform the possibilities offered by technology and by digital technology, into objects, machines and physical products. »</i></p>

<p>The event lasted four days, with the presence of two hundred European makers selected and invited to present their projects. Many workshops, talks and live performances. Stands were really well made and I&#39;ve noticed, in this first edition, a lot of attention towards 3D printers with numerous proposals by the creators from all countries and the use of different materials such as resin, plastic and nylon. An entire floor of the building was occupied by Fab Labs, workshops able to provide tools and technology to achieve by themselves their own devices.</p>

<p>I took some photos and a couple of videos, you can find them on my Facebook page. And this, was definitely the coolest thing of the whole event:</p>
